#summary This page presents the javascript package ClusterMap

= Introduction =

This project provides a javascript package to visualize clusters of markers on Google Maps (API v3). It can cluster and represent hundreds and thousands of markers.

It is very quick and highly configurable.
It is very quick because clustering is done once for all and the result is stored in an tree for fast retrieval of useful clusters when the user zooms in or out. 

Points are clustered using the [http://code.google.com/p/figue/ figue javascript clustering library].
