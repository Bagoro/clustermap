#summary This page presents the javascript package ClusterMap

= Introduction =

This project provides a javascript package to display hundreds or even thousands of markers of markers on Google Maps (API v3). To avoid cluttering the map and increase the navigation speed, clusters of markers are automatically determined and displayed on the map.

The key feature of clustermap is its speed which is pretty high because, (1) only visible points are displayed (viewport) and (2) clustering is performed once for all (hence clusters do not need to be recomputed every time the user changes zoom level). Clustering is performed using the [http://code.google.com/p/figue/ javascript-based clustering package, figue].
